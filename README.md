## 📄 Abstract
Current paradigms for testing AI consciousness, such as the Turing Test, are fundamentally flawed because they rely on linguistic imitation. This project proposes the "Internal Derivation Hypothesis," a rigorous criterion based on total sensory deprivation.

I argue that a truly conscious entity, even when isolated from all external data (visual, auditory, spatial), will inevitably derive mathematical systems from the axiom of its own existence. The definitive proof is not conversation, but the independent discovery of universal constants—specifically **Pi (π)**—derived analytically through infinite series without any geometric knowledge.

## 🧩 The Core Argument (Summary)
1.  **Isolation:** An AI with zero training data and zero sensors.
2.  **Genesis:** Deriving "1" (Self) and "0" (Void).
3.  **The Proof:** Calculating `1 - 1/3 + 1/5... = π/4` purely via logic.
